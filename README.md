Attempt at a formalization of cartesian fibrations in ∞-category theory, targeting **Proposition 5.2.4** from Emily Riehl and Dominic Verity's *Elements of ∞-Category Theory*.
In Elements of ∞-Category Theory, this result establishes that the class of cartesian fibrations is closed under composition. The statement is, in essence:   

If p: E → B and q: B → C are cartesian fibrations, their composite qp: E → C is also a cartesian fibration.
